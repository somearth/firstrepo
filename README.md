# Playing aroung with github for the first time

* Tested password less push with ssh key
* Added a new branch dev
* Merged dev branch into master
* Deleted dev branch
* Checking out the CLI diff tool
* Removed from index ('git reset' which is the exact opposite of 'git add')
* Tried out kdiff3 with difftool command
* Added a sample gitignore file
* Multiline commit message
* List out staged changes before/after adding to index
* List out commits that are not yet pushed
* Revert the workspace copy to match that in the index (git checkout <filename>)
* Revert the index copy to match that in the local branch HEAD (git reset <filename>)
* Revert the workspace copy to match that in the local branch HEAD (first reset, then checkout)
